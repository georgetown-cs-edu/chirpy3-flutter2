        <p>
            Hello.  It is now ${date}.  Sadly, Chirpy doesn't do much currently.  But you'll fix that!  (Yay!)

        <p>
            Here's a list of random numbers:
            <ul>
                <#list randvector as randNum>
                    <li>${randNum}</li>
                </#list>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also go to the <a href="/formtest/">form test</a> page or <a href="/listcookies/">this page</a> which lists the cookies.
